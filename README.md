Goal: to build a predictive machine learning model for 311 service requests.

(That means, given the location, date and time, the model is able to predict the type of service request 311 may encounter.)


Benefit: Help government to allocate resources more efficiently. Which would mean:

   * Our citizens are attended to quicker
   * Our city runs smoother
   * Government saves money


We approached this problem in two parts:

   1. Exploratory data analysis
   2. Multi-layer classification model with probabilistic prediction 
   *  We also built an interactive dashboard (where you can internet with the date and see your prediction)
